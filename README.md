# FaceRecognizerOMOD
OpenMRS module for face recognition

## JavaCV
We are using JavaCV 1.3 to implement face recognition. [JavaCV](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv) is a [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) wrapper for Java. We can extend the 
functionality of [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org/) with modules. The module is called `omod`. `omod` is self-contained. It has the code
 and dependencies of the code.
